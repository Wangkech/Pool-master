# âœ¨ New Features

### ðŸ”¹ Archive Player

The **Archive Player** feature allows players to temporarily leave the game or skip a round.

- Players who archive themselves:

  - Keep all their records (scores, wins) accumulated while active.
  - Are removed from the active game and leaderboard, so only active players influence rankings.

- Archived players can rejoin later.

  - Their past data will be restored automatically.
  - Any missed rounds will be shown as **hyphens (-)** in their record.

- Players can also choose to **permanently leave** the game.

  - In this case, their stored data will not affect the ranking of active players.

# âœ… Current Progress

- Added an `active` status flag to each playerâ€™s profile in the `playerList` object (`true` by default).
- Clicking the **Archive** button sets the playerâ€™s status to `false`.
- Archived players are hidden from the UI.

---

# ðŸ”§ Work in Progress (Stability & Usability)

- Currently, the archive button (`archive-player`) is hidden (`display: none`) while the feature is being stabilized.
- Next steps:

  - Ensure seamless re-entry of archived players.
  - Handle permanent removal separately.
  - Update leaderboard/history views accordingly.
